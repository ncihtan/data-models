We are always looking for ways to improve our data models.  If there is
an issue with an existing term - or if you have a suggestion - [let us know](https://github.com/ncihtan/data-models/issues/new?assignees=aditigopalan&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.md&title=%5Bbug%5D+)!

Please note that changing existing terminology may result in breaking
changes downstream, so not all suggestions will be considered unless
they are well-justified.
